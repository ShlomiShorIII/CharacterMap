This tool analyzes texts to automatically generate social networks of characters, based on their co-occurrences within the text. By identifying characters and their relationships, the tool offers insights into character interactions, social circles, and relationship strengths, providing a fresh perspective on narrative dynamics.The current implementation is based on Jules Verne's Around the World in Eighty Days.
